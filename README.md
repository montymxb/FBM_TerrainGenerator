# FBM_TerrrainGenerator
Fractal Brownian Motion Terrain Generator. Produces land, water, and sky components. Demonstrational.

Using shaders exclusively, feeds in results from a hash function to create a reasonable distribution of values to then feed into fbm.
Although not truly random, the results are fairly good. The hash function itself isn't of great quality, but it allows this kind of terrain generation to be independent of feeding texture data into glsl, and to that end does a pretty good job.
